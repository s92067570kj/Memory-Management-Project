# Memory Management Mini Project

## Overview
This project simulates memory allocation and deallocation using the **First Fit** dynamic memory allocation algorithm. It is implemented in Python and includes features like memory block initialization, allocation, deallocation, and status display.

## Features
- **Allocate Memory**: Allocates memory blocks to processes using the First Fit algorithm.
- **Deallocate Memory**: Frees memory blocks assigned to processes.
- **Display Memory Status**: Shows the current state of memory blocks.

## Code Structure
- **memory_block.py**: Defines the `MemoryBlock` class representing individual memory blocks.
- **memory_manager.py**: Implements the `FirstFitMemoryManager` class with allocation and deallocation methods.
- **main.py**: Provides a user interface for interacting with the memory manager.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
